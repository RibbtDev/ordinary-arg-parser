# Ordinary Arg Parser

OrdinaryArgParser implements all essential POSIX features (short options, grouping, positional args, terminal marker) and extends them with GNU conveniences (long options, --no- negation, aliases, transforms). It goes beyond both standards by adding schema-driven features like default values and custom transformations.
